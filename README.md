# Line-Follower-Robot_Arduino
This Arduino-based project is a line follower robot that uses five infrared (IR) sensors to detect and follow a black line on a white surface. The robot is controlled by a simple algorithm that adjusts the speed and direction of its motors based on sensor readings, allowing it to navigate along the line.
